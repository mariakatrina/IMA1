                        <b>Entrance:</b>
                        I enter into the website and I am welcomed by a moving image of a microorganism within a 
                        small window, stimuating a browser window within a window. The microorganism welcomes me 
                        and I see a button on the bottom right which says "Next" which I click. In the next two
                        pages of the browser the microorganism shows me a tutorial on how to use the website. It 
                        is detailed and easy to follow.
                        <br> <br>
                        <b>Main interface:</b> 
                        The main window consists of a virtual glass bowl with another mini browser-window on the 
                        top right, showing the user the tools that are accessible to them. This window consists of
                        elements such as <i>Sand, Water, Wood, Bacteria</i> and <i> all sorts of fish.</i> There is
                        also a meter in this space that shows CO2 and O2 levels within the orb farm which the users 
                        must maintain to have a healthy aquascape. I start by creating a virtual aquascape using the 
                        sand, wood and grass. When I was happy with how my tank was looking, I added fish and just
                        sat back and enjoyed the way the virtual ecosystem interacted with each other.
                        <br><br>
                        Thankfully due to my minimal experience with keeping aquariums as a hobby, I 
                        didn't crash the mini ecosystem and kept everything within the green zone. The website included
                        a helpful educational tool about fish and underwater microorganisms and environments through the 
                        <i>info</i> tool, which I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated reading as a fish-keeper myself.
                </p>
            <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was immediately captured by the moving background image which involved calming, zen pixel 
                        animations of a day cycle, cycling from dusk to dawn. At the same time, I was also drawn to the 
                        tools we can use to create my aquascape which shaped my entire experience with the Orb Farm.
                    </p>
                <h3>What did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I definitely spent the most time engaging with creating the aquascape within the Orb
                        and experimenting with the different tools, seeing what these different elements can do 
                        and interact with each other.
                    </p>
                <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
                    <p>It was definitely clicking and dragging, shaping the environment using the <i>Sand, Grass</i> and <i>Wood</i> tool and drawing these features into the orb.</p>
                <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The intended goal is to allow users to learn about the delicate nature of aquatic ecosystems, as well as 
                        to experience the simple joys of caring for and designing an aquascape.
                    </p>
                <h3>How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The website has two primary goals; to educate and to enjoy. It does this by the instructions given to the user, as well as the <i>info</i>> used to educate the 
                        user with interesting facts about the different types of organisms that inhabit the aquatic space. It allows the 
                        user to enjoy the experience by allowing them to decorate their orb, the relaxing  background animation, as well as 
                        seeing the organisms interact within the Orb, watch virtual life pass by.
                    </p>
                <h3>What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I feel it has a suitable length for me. Once my ecosystem kicked off, I started relaxing and watching
                        the life within my virtual environment grow. It did get boring after a while with the same view, but I was still able to
                        manipulate and change the environment even while its playing, so it was never really a dull moment for me.

                    <h5>METAPHORS</h5>                    
                    <h4>
                        What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The idea of an orb farm where you can grow your own eco system is drawn on the metaphor of
                        this virtual environment being a virtual fish bowl, a simulation of life. The orb is very similar to 
                        the common fish bowl used to grow and raise (albiet in reality, fisbowls being unsuitable 
                        environment for) aquatic pets. The everchanging background art of a sunset to sunrise is to 
                        emulate the natural environment drawn from nature, to create a sense of time within the design 
                        in and how different elements may interact with each other overtime. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        These elements interacting together offers the user with a zen-like encounter, expressing the game 
                        as not just an educational tool but a relaxation tool as its true essence. When I established this,
                        I began interacting with the <i>Orb Farm</i> with care by observing the elements within the eco system,
                        and noticed how relaxing it was watching life pass by. I didn't feel pressured to keep the orb within 
                        the optimum parameters. Despite loading it with thirty fish at one point; it was a forgiving ecosystem. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        It was frustrating how it didn't quite feel like a challenge, but that was never part of the design.
                        It frustrated me that the design was truly what it was; a relaxing, educational game where you watch 
                        pixelated fish and microbiota emulate life. Nothing more, nothing less.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        It was incredibly satisfying creating the aquascape and environment as I've always enjoyed creating
                        them. I grew up with games that allow you to change and decorate the space like The Sims series and 
                        Animal Crossing, so <i>Orb Farm</i> gave me a sense of nostalgia and that childhood comfort. I also
                        take care of fish in scaped aquariums in real life, so decorating a scape for free (even when it's
                        digital) is always a great creative opportunity for me to express my love of aquascaping and aquariums.
